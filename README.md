_LED Driver_

- finish serial interface (recognition of complete data protocol)
- split the color functions in a seperate class (don't use the ColorHandler class for this)
- Integrate color effects
- look into the order of the color channels and possibly correct the order in the data protocol (RGBa or aBGR?)
