# Kastl

A smart bedside table with gesture control, a mobile app and various features like indirect lighting, alarms and possibly music.


# ToDo

- [IMPORTANT] initialize all pins according to the 4 Meschik rules [IMPORTANT]
- timeout between gestures (on/off shouldn't happen more often than eg 2 seconds)
- look into the alpha channel stuff -> global alpha (where is alpha edited/overruled?)
- look into the order of the color channels and possibly correct the order in the data protocol (RGBa or aBGR?)
- look into the order of the serial connection (android app)

# ToDo long term

the change from strips to light groups was absolutely horrific (breathing effect uses some hack to make it work which is BAD, but works)
