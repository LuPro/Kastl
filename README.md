# ToDo

_LED Driver_

- timeout between gestures (on/off shouldn't happen more often than eg 2 seconds)
- look into the alpha channel stuff -> global alpha (where is alpha edited/overruled?)
- look into the order of the color channels and possibly correct the order in the data protocol (RGBa or aBGR?)
- look into the order of the serial connection (android app)
